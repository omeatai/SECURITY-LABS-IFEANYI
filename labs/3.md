## Pentesting Fundamentals

##### +What is Penetration Testing?

<details>
  <summary>What is the main responsibility of a penetration tester?</summary>

  - [ ] The main responsibility of a penetration tester is to find vulnerabilities in a client's application or system by simulating attacks using tools, techniques, and methodologies similar to those used by malicious actors.
  - [ ] Penetration testers follow defined processes to perform pentests while upholding ethical standards.
  - [ ] Their work often includes providing reports and recommendations to strengthen the security posture of organizations.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why is cybersecurity important in the modern world?</summary>

  - [ ] Cybersecurity is vital for everyone—to protect personal information such as emails with strong password policies.
  - [ ] It is important for businesses and organizations to secure their devices and sensitive data from damages or theft.
  - [ ] The rise of frequent cyber attacks and data leaks, highlighted regularly in news headlines, makes cybersecurity a relevant issue across all aspects of life.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How is a penetration test (pentest) defined?</summary>

  - [ ] A penetration test, or pentest, is an ethically-driven process to test and analyze an organization’s security defenses regarding their assets and information.
  - [ ] It effectively simulates what a real attacker might do, using comparable tools, techniques, and approaches.
  - [ ] The pentest serves a function similar to an audit, aiming to identify and address weaknesses before they are exploited by malicious actors.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How frequent are cyber attacks according to Security Magazine?</summary>

  - [ ] Security Magazine reports that there are over 2,200 cyber attacks every day.
  - [ ] This averages out to 1 attack every 39 seconds globally.

</details>

##### +Penetration Testing Ethics

<details>
  <summary>Why are legality and ethics controversial in cybersecurity and penetration testing?</summary>

Legal and ethical issues in cybersecurity are controversial because:

- The term "hacker" often has negative connotations due to criminal activity.
- Understanding "legal hacking," such as penetration testing, can be challenging.
- Legality in penetration testing is determined by explicit, owner-agreed authorization (scope).
- Anything outside the agreed scope is unlawful and unauthorized.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What makes a penetration test legal?</summary>

A penetration test is legal if:

- The tester has explicit, written authorization from the system's owner.
- The scope (tools, techniques, systems, and boundaries) is clearly defined beforehand.
- The activities remain strictly within the agreed-upon parameters.

If activities fall outside this agreement, they are unauthorized (illegal).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the importance of scope in penetration testing agreements?</summary>

The scope is essential because:

- It defines what can and cannot be tested.
- It specifies authorized tools and techniques.
- It determines legal coverage and the direction of the test.
- Both the tester and system owner must formally agree on the scope before any testing begins.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How are companies that provide penetration testing held accountable?</summary>

Companies are held accountable by:

- Legal frameworks and regulations relevant to their jurisdiction.
- Industry accreditations, such as:
  - The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) CHECK scheme in the UK.
    - Only CHECK-approved companies can perform authorized penetration tests on public sector and critical national infrastructure (CNI) systems.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How does ethics differ from legality in penetration testing?</summary>

Ethics refers to:

- The moral judgment of right or wrong, which can differ from legal boundaries.
- Some actions that are legal (within the authorized scope) may still be ethically questionable depending on personal or organizational values.
- Examples:
  - Accessing sensitive data during a test.
  - Running social engineering attacks on employees.
  - If agreed upon in scope, these may be legal but still raise ethical concerns.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Hackers are sorted into what three hats?</summary>

  - [ ] White Hat - These hackers are considered the "good people". They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others. (e.g., a penetration tester performing an authorised engagement)
  - [ ] Grey Hat - These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times. (e.g., someone taking down a scamming site)
  - [ ] Black Hat - These people are criminals and often seek to damage organisations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others. (e.g., ransomware authors infecting devices and holding data for ransom)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a Rules of Engagement (ROE) document in penetration testing?</summary>

A Rules of Engagement (ROE) document is created at the beginning of a penetration testing engagement. It defines:

- How the engagement will be conducted
- The legal and operational boundaries
- What is explicitly allowed or prohibited during the test

ROE protects both the tester and the organization by providing clear guidelines.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the three main sections of a Rules of Engagement (ROE) document?</summary>

The three main sections of an ROE document are:

- [ ] **Permission:** Explicit authorization for the penetration test to take place. Essential for legal protection of all parties involved.
- [ ] **Test Scope:** Clearly lists the specific targets (e.g., servers, applications) that are within the engagement. Limits where tests can be performed.
- [ ] **Rules:** Details exactly what techniques are allowed or prohibited during the test (e.g., phishing disallowed, but Man-in-the-Middle attacks permitted).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why is there no single, universal penetration testing approach?</summary>

There is no universal approach because:

- Penetration tests have diverse objectives and targets.
- Each engagement's scope and environment are unique.
- Methodologies must be adapted to the situation (e.g., testing a web application differs from testing a network).

</details>

##### +Penetration Testing Methodology

<details>
  <summary>What is a penetration testing methodology?</summary>

A penetration testing methodology is the step-by-step approach a tester takes during an engagement. It should be practical and relevant to the specific test objective and scope.

- Methodologies are tailored to the situation (network, web app, etc.).
- They provide structure and consistency for the engagement.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the general stages present in all industry-standard penetration testing methodologies?</summary>

The stages include:

- [ ] **Information Gathering:** Collecting public and open-source information about the target or organization (e.g., OSINT, research). This does NOT involve interacting with or scanning systems.
- [ ] **Enumeration/Scanning:** Identifying applications and services running on the target systems (e.g., finding web servers, open ports).
- [ ] **Exploitation:** Using discovered vulnerabilities to gain access or control. This can involve public exploits or exploiting flaws in logic.
- [ ] **Privilege Escalation:** Expanding access within the system after initial exploitation. Can be:
    - Horizontal escalation: Access another account with similar privileges.
    - Vertical escalation: Gain higher-level (e.g., administrator) access.
- [ ] **Post-exploitation:** Actions taken after gaining deeper access, including:
    - Pivoting to other hosts
    - Gathering additional information as a privileged user
    - Covering your tracks
    - Reporting findings

    - The tester is not given any information about the inner workings of the application or service.
    - Acts as a regular user; focuses on functionality and interface interaction.
    - No programming knowledge required.
    - Information gathering and enumeration takes longer.
  - [ ] **Grey-Box Testing**
    - The tester has limited knowledge of the internal components.
    - Combines approaches of both black-box and white-box testing.
    - Tester uses limited knowledge to aid testing and resolve findings.
    - Saves time and is popular for well-hardened attack surfaces.
  - [ ] **White-Box Testing**
    - The tester has full knowledge of the application's internal workings.
    - Typically performed by someone with programming and application logic expertise.
    - Involves detailed testing of internal components and expected behaviors.
    - More time-consuming but validates the entire attack surface.

## Principles of Security
##### +The CIA Triad

<details>
  <summary>What is the CIA triad in information security?</summary>

  - [ ] The CIA triad is an information security model used to guide the creation of security policies.
  - [ ] It consists of three key elements: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
  - [ ] The model is a continuous cycle and all three elements must be addressed for effective security.
  - [ ] If even one element is not met, the security policy is considered ineffective.
  - [ ] The triad applies beyond cybersecurity, covering all information security (e.g., filing, record storage).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What does Confidentiality mean in the CIA triad?</summary>

  - [ ] Protection of data from unauthorized access and misuse.
  - [ ] Ensures only intended parties (e.g., HR for employee records) can access sensitive information.
  - [ ] Utilizes access controls, vetting, and sometimes classification systems (e.g., government sensitivity ratings like top-secret or classified).
  - [ ] Examples: Employee records accessible only to HR, accounting documents with moderate restrictions.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What does Integrity mean in the CIA triad?</summary>

  - [ ] Ensures information is accurate, consistent, and only changes in an authorized manner.
  - [ ] Maintained by preventing unauthorized or accidental modification during storage, transmission, and usage.
  - [ ] Controls used include:
      - Access controls and rigorous authentication
      - Hash verifications and digital signatures for ensuring authenticity and detecting modification or corruption.
  - [ ] Example: Preventing unauthorized users from editing sensitive records.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What does Availability mean in the CIA triad?</summary>

  - [ ] Ensures data is accessible and usable by authorized users when needed.
  - [ ] Key concern for organizations, often reflected in uptime requirements (e.g., 99.99% uptime).
  - [ ] Lack of availability can damage reputation and cause financial loss.
  - [ ] Achieved by:
      - Using reliable and tested hardware
      - Implementing redundant systems for failover
      - Applying strong security protocols to defend against attacks

</details>

##### +Principles of Privileges

<details>
  <summary>What factors determine the levels of access given to individuals in IT systems?</summary>

  - [ ] The individual’s role or function within the organization.
  - [ ] The sensitivity of the information stored on the system.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Privileged Access Management (PAM)?</summary>

  - [ ] **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**: Translates a user's organizational role into an appropriate access role on a system.
  - [ ] **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**: Manages the privileges assigned to a system’s access role and additional security practices (e.g., password management, auditing, reducing attack surface).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the principle of least privilege?</summary>

  - [ ] Users are given only the minimum privileges necessary to perform their duties.
  - [ ] Limiting privileges helps build trust in system operations and access controls.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What features beyond access assignment does PAM include?</summary>

  - [ ] Enforcing security policies, such as:
    - Password management
    - Auditing policies
    - Reducing the system's attack surface

</details>

##### +Security Models Continued

<details>
  <summary>What is the purpose of security models in relation to the CIA triad?</summary>

  - [ ] Security models provide formal frameworks for achieving the three elements of the CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
  - [ ] Any system or device that stores information is called an information system under these models.
  - [ ] Security models guide how information systems manage and control access to data.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the Bell-La Padula Model and how does it achieve confidentiality?</summary>

  - [ ] The Bell-La Padula Model focuses on achieving confidentiality.
  - [ ] Assumes an organizational hierarchy with well-defined roles and responsibilities.
  - [ ] Access to data ("objects") is granted on a "need to know" basis.
  - [ ] Key rules:
      - “No write down”: Users cannot write information to a lower classification level.
      - “No read up”: Users cannot read data at a higher classification level.
  - [ ] Popular in governmental and military organizations where members are vetted and trusted.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Bell-La Padula Model?</summary>

  **Advantages:**
  - [ ] Policies can be mapped to real-life organizational hierarchies.
  - [ ] Simple to implement and understand.
  - [ ] Proven to be successful in structured organizations.

  **Disadvantages:**
  - [ ] Users may know about the existence of data objects they cannot access (not entirely confidential).
  - [ ] Relies on a high degree of trust within the organization.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the Biba Model and how does it achieve integrity?</summary>

  - [ ] The Biba Model applies to the integrity component of the CIA triad.
  - [ ] Uses the rule: “No write up, no read down.”
      - Users can create/write to objects at their level or lower, but only read objects at higher levels.
  - [ ] Often used where integrity is more important than confidentiality (e.g., software development).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Biba Model?</summary>

  **Advantages:**
  - [ ] Simple to implement.
  - [ ] Addresses both confidentiality limitations and data integrity issues.

  **Disadvantages:**
  - [ ] Can have many access levels and objects, making controls complex and prone to oversight.
  - [ ] May cause delays (e.g., professionals unable to access information from lower-level users).
