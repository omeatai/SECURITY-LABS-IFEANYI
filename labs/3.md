## Pentesting Fundamentals

##### What is Penetration Testing?

<details>
  <summary>What is the main responsibility of a penetration tester?</summary>

  - [ ] The main responsibility of a penetration tester is to find vulnerabilities in a client's application or system by simulating attacks using tools, techniques, and methodologies similar to those used by malicious actors.
  - [ ] Penetration testers follow defined processes to perform pentests while upholding ethical standards.
  - [ ] Their work often includes providing reports and recommendations to strengthen the security posture of organizations.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why is cybersecurity important in the modern world?</summary>

  - [ ] Cybersecurity is vital for everyone—to protect personal information such as emails with strong password policies.
  - [ ] It is important for businesses and organizations to secure their devices and sensitive data from damages or theft.
  - [ ] The rise of frequent cyber attacks and data leaks, highlighted regularly in news headlines, makes cybersecurity a relevant issue across all aspects of life.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How is a penetration test (pentest) defined?</summary>

  - [ ] A penetration test, or pentest, is an ethically-driven process to test and analyze an organization’s security defenses regarding their assets and information.
  - [ ] It effectively simulates what a real attacker might do, using comparable tools, techniques, and approaches.
  - [ ] The pentest serves a function similar to an audit, aiming to identify and address weaknesses before they are exploited by malicious actors.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How frequent are cyber attacks according to Security Magazine?</summary>

  - [ ] Security Magazine reports that there are over 2,200 cyber attacks every day.
  - [ ] This averages out to 1 attack every 39 seconds globally.

</details>

##### Penetration Testing Ethics

<details>
  <summary>Why are legality and ethics controversial in cybersecurity and penetration testing?</summary>

Legal and ethical issues in cybersecurity are controversial because:

- The term "hacker" often has negative connotations due to criminal activity.
- Understanding "legal hacking," such as penetration testing, can be challenging.
- Legality in penetration testing is determined by explicit, owner-agreed authorization (scope).
- Anything outside the agreed scope is unlawful and unauthorized.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What makes a penetration test legal?</summary>

A penetration test is legal if:

- The tester has explicit, written authorization from the system's owner.
- The scope (tools, techniques, systems, and boundaries) is clearly defined beforehand.
- The activities remain strictly within the agreed-upon parameters.

If activities fall outside this agreement, they are unauthorized (illegal).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the importance of scope in penetration testing agreements?</summary>

The scope is essential because:

- It defines what can and cannot be tested.
- It specifies authorized tools and techniques.
- It determines legal coverage and the direction of the test.
- Both the tester and system owner must formally agree on the scope before any testing begins.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How are companies that provide penetration testing held accountable?</summary>

Companies are held accountable by:

- Legal frameworks and regulations relevant to their jurisdiction.
- Industry accreditations, such as:
  - The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) CHECK scheme in the UK.
    - Only CHECK-approved companies can perform authorized penetration tests on public sector and critical national infrastructure (CNI) systems.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How does ethics differ from legality in penetration testing?</summary>

Ethics refers to:

- The moral judgment of right or wrong, which can differ from legal boundaries.
- Some actions that are legal (within the authorized scope) may still be ethically questionable depending on personal or organizational values.
- Examples:
  - Accessing sensitive data during a test.
  - Running social engineering attacks on employees.
  - If agreed upon in scope, these may be legal but still raise ethical concerns.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Hackers are sorted into what three hats?</summary>

  - [ ] White Hat - These hackers are considered the "good people". They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others. (e.g., a penetration tester performing an authorised engagement)
  - [ ] Grey Hat - These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times. (e.g., someone taking down a scamming site)
  - [ ] Black Hat - These people are criminals and often seek to damage organisations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others. (e.g., ransomware authors infecting devices and holding data for ransom)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a Rules of Engagement (ROE) document in penetration testing?</summary>

A Rules of Engagement (ROE) document is created at the beginning of a penetration testing engagement. It defines:

- How the engagement will be conducted
- The legal and operational boundaries
- What is explicitly allowed or prohibited during the test

ROE protects both the tester and the organization by providing clear guidelines.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the three main sections of a Rules of Engagement (ROE) document?</summary>

The three main sections of an ROE document are:

- [ ] **Permission:** Explicit authorization for the penetration test to take place. Essential for legal protection of all parties involved.
- [ ] **Test Scope:** Clearly lists the specific targets (e.g., servers, applications) that are within the engagement. Limits where tests can be performed.
- [ ] **Rules:** Details exactly what techniques are allowed or prohibited during the test (e.g., phishing disallowed, but Man-in-the-Middle attacks permitted).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why is there no single, universal penetration testing approach?</summary>

There is no universal approach because:

- Penetration tests have diverse objectives and targets.
- Each engagement's scope and environment are unique.
- Methodologies must be adapted to the situation (e.g., testing a web application differs from testing a network).

</details>

##### Penetration Testing Methodology

<details>
  <summary>What is a penetration testing methodology?</summary>

A penetration testing methodology is the step-by-step approach a tester takes during an engagement. It should be practical and relevant to the specific test objective and scope.

- Methodologies are tailored to the situation (network, web app, etc.).
- They provide structure and consistency for the engagement.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the general stages present in all industry-standard penetration testing methodologies?</summary>

The stages include:

- [ ] **Information Gathering:** Collecting public and open-source information about the target or organization (e.g., OSINT, research). This does NOT involve interacting with or scanning systems.
- [ ] **Enumeration/Scanning:** Identifying applications and services running on the target systems (e.g., finding web servers, open ports).
- [ ] **Exploitation:** Using discovered vulnerabilities to gain access or control. This can involve public exploits or exploiting flaws in logic.
- [ ] **Privilege Escalation:** Expanding access within the system after initial exploitation. Can be:
    - Horizontal escalation: Access another account with similar privileges.
    - Vertical escalation: Gain higher-level (e.g., administrator) access.
- [ ] **Post-exploitation:** Actions taken after gaining deeper access, including:
    - Pivoting to other hosts
    - Gathering additional information as a privileged user
    - Covering your tracks
    - Reporting findings

##### Black Box, Gray Box and White Box Penetration Testing

<details>
  <summary>What are the three primary scopes of testing in a penetration testing engagement?</summary>

  - [ ] **Black-Box Testing**
    - The tester is not given any information about the inner workings of the application or service.
    - Acts as a regular user; focuses on functionality and interface interaction.
    - No programming knowledge required.
    - Information gathering and enumeration takes longer.
  - [ ] **Grey-Box Testing**
    - The tester has limited knowledge of the internal components.
    - Combines approaches of both black-box and white-box testing.
    - Tester uses limited knowledge to aid testing and resolve findings.
    - Saves time and is popular for well-hardened attack surfaces.
  - [ ] **White-Box Testing**
    - The tester has full knowledge of the application's internal workings.
    - Typically performed by someone with programming and application logic expertise.
    - Involves detailed testing of internal components and expected behaviors.
    - More time-consuming but validates the entire attack surface.
