  <summary>Hackers are sorted into what three hats?</summary>

  - [ ] White Hat - These hackers are considered the "good people". They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others.
  - [ ] Grey Hat - These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times.
  - [ ] Black Hat - These people are criminals and often seek to damage organisations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others.

  <summary>How do you create a new file in Linux?</summary>

### touch (Create file)

```bs
tryhackme@linux2:~$ ls
important  myfile  myfolder  unknown1

tryhackme@linux2:~$ touch note.txt
tryhackme@linux2:~$ ls
important  myfile  myfolder  note.txt  unknown1
```

I want you to create a prompt for my OpenAI Assistant. I am learning cyber security and i want to create a github markdown page where i can store my knowledge gained in question and answer format (in accordion form) while i learn. Here is a sample:
imagine i paste this:

Hackers are sorted into three hats, where their ethics and motivations behind their actions determine what hat category they are placed into. Let's cover these three in the table below:

Hat Category	Description	Example
White Hat	These hackers are considered the "good people". They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others.	For example, a penetration tester performing an authorised engagement on a company.
Grey Hat	These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times.	For example, someone taking down a scamming site.
Black Hat	These people are criminals and often seek to damage organisations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others.	For example, ransomware authors infect devices with malicious code and hold data for ransom.

Then i expect you to give me something like this in code format:

And if i paste something like this:

Creating files and folders on Linux is a simple process. First, we'll cover creating a file. The touch command takes exactly one argument -- the name we want to give the file we create. For example, we can create the file "note" by using touch note. It's worth noting that touch simply creates a blank file. You would need to use commands like echo or text editors such as nano to add content to the blank file.

I expect you to give me something like this:
