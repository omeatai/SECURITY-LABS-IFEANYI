## Offensive Security Intro

<details>
<summary>What is Offensve Security</summary>

  - [ ] "Offensive Security." It involves breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access.
  - [ ] The goal is to understand hacker tactics and enhance our system defences.

<details>
<summary>Using Gobuster To Find Hidden Website Pages</summary>

  - [ ] used to brute-force a website to find hidden directories and pages.
  - [ ] Gobuster will take a list of potential page or directory names and try accessing a website with each of them; if the page exists, it tells you.

  ```sh
  gobuster -u http://fakebank.thm -w wordlist.txt dir
  ```
  - [ ] -u is used to state the website we're scanning
  - [ ] -w takes a list of words to iterate through to find hidden pages.

## Defensive Security Intro

<details>
<summary>What is Defensive Security</summary>

  It is concerned with two main tasks:
  
  - [ ]  Preventing intrusions from occurring
  - [ ]  Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly

  What is a SOC?
  - [ ] A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events. 
  - [ ] Vulnerabilities: Whenever a system vulnerability (weakness) is discovered, it is essential to fix it by installing a proper update or patch. When a fix is unavailable, the necessary measures should be taken to prevent an attacker from exploiting it. Although remediating vulnerabilities is vital to a SOC, it is not necessarily assigned to them.
  - [ ] Policy violations: A security policy is a set of rules required to protect the network and systems. For example, it might be a policy violation if users upload confidential company data to an online storage service.
  - [ ] Unauthorized activity: Consider the case where a user’s login name and password are stolen, and the attacker uses them to log into the network. A SOC must detect and block such an event as soon as possible before further damage is done.
  - [ ] Network intrusions: No matter how good your security is, there is always a chance for an intrusion. An intrusion can occur when a user clicks on a malicious link or when an attacker exploits a public server. Either way, when an intrusion occurs, we must detect it as soon as possible to prevent further damage.
