## Introduction

Offensive Security is about thinking like an attacker to find weaknesses before real hackers do. In this TryHackMe room, you hack your first website in a safe and legal environment using FakeBank, a fake banking application, to see how ethical hackers operate.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **Think like a hacker**
  - Offensive Security means simulating a hacker's actions to find weaknesses
  - The room lets you practice ethical hacking against FakeBank in a controlled lab
- [x] **Starting the lab**
  - The room uses a virtual desktop to simulate a real system
  - A browser opens automatically and displays FakeBank, the target application
  - Your bank account number in FakeBank is **8881**
- [x] **Find hidden pages**
  - A common weakness is leaving hidden pages accessible (e.g. admin or transfer panels)
  - Use the terminal on the machine to run **dirb** (Dirbuster-style directory brute-forcing)
  - Lines in dirb output that start with `+` are pages that were found
  - Dirb finds two URLs on FakeBank: `/images` and `/bank-transfer`
- [x] **Attack the admin page**
  - The hidden admin panel at `/bank-transfer` lets you add money to an account
  - Open `http://fakebank.thm/bank-transfer` in the simulated browser (append `/bank-transfer` to the URL)
  - Use account number **8881** and deposit **$2000** (or more)
  - Return to your account page and confirm the balance is positive
  - When the balance turns positive, a green pop-up appears with the words **BANK-HACKED** (ALL CAPS)

## Terminal Commands

Dirb is used to discover hidden directories and pages on a target website. Pass the target URL; any output lines starting with `+` indicate discovered pages.

```bash
dirb http://fakebank.thm
```

Example idea of what you are looking for: dirb reports existing paths such as `http://fakebank.thm/images` and `http://fakebank.thm/bank-transfer`. Use the hidden `/bank-transfer` path in the browser to continue the attack.

## Code

No code sections in this room; the activity uses terminal commands (dirb) and the FakeBank web interface only.
