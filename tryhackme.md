  <summary>Offensive Security Intro</summary>

## Introduction

Offensive Security is about thinking like an attacker to find weaknesses before real hackers do. In this TryHackMe room, you hack your first website in a safe and legal environment using FakeBank, a fake banking application, to see how ethical hackers operate.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **Think like a hacker**
  - Offensive Security means simulating a hacker's actions to find weaknesses
  - The room lets you practice ethical hacking against FakeBank in a controlled lab
- [x] **Starting the lab**
  - The room uses a virtual desktop to simulate a real system
  - A browser opens automatically and displays FakeBank, the target application
  - Your bank account number in FakeBank is **8881**
- [x] **Find hidden pages**
  - A common weakness is leaving hidden pages accessible (e.g. admin or transfer panels)
  - Use the terminal on the machine to run **dirb** (Dirbuster-style directory brute-forcing)
  - Lines in dirb output that start with `+` are pages that were found
  - Dirb finds two URLs on FakeBank: `/images` and `/bank-transfer`
- [x] **Attack the admin page**
  - The hidden admin panel at `/bank-transfer` lets you add money to an account
  - Open `http://fakebank.thm/bank-transfer` in the simulated browser (append `/bank-transfer` to the URL)
  - Use account number **8881** and deposit **$2000** (or more)
  - Return to your account page and confirm the balance is positive
  - When the balance turns positive, a green pop-up appears with the words **BANK-HACKED** (ALL CAPS)

## Lab

This is the room's **FakeBank** walkthrough on the TryHackMe virtual desktop. Work only in that lab. Pause until the machine is on and the FakeBank browser tab is visible.

### **Overview**

- [ ] Practice offensive security against **FakeBank** in a legal lab.
- [ ] You will:
  - [ ] Start the virtual desktop and note account **8881**.
  - [ ] Use **dirb** to find hidden pages.
  - [ ] Open `/bank-transfer`, deposit funds, and confirm the balance.
- [ ] Success: the account page shows a positive balance and a green pop-up **BANK-HACKED**.

### **Task 1: Start the lab**

- [ ] Click **Start Machine** (or **Show Split View** if the desktop is hidden).
- [ ] Wait until the simulated browser opens **FakeBank**.
- [ ] Note your FakeBank account number: **8881**.

### **Task 2: Find hidden pages**

- [ ] Open the **Terminal** on the lab machine.
- [ ] Run directory brute-force against FakeBank:

```bash
dirb http://fakebank.thm
```

- [ ] In the output, treat lines that start with `+` as discovered pages.
- [ ] Confirm dirb reports `/images` and `/bank-transfer`.

### **Task 3: Use the transfer page**

- [ ] In the simulated browser, open `http://fakebank.thm/bank-transfer`.
- [ ] Use account number **8881**.
- [ ] Deposit **$2000** (or more).
- [ ] Return to your account page and confirm the balance is positive.
- [ ] Read the green pop-up: **BANK-HACKED** (ALL CAPS).

Successfully completed the FakeBank lab when the balance is positive and **BANK-HACKED** is shown.

  <summary>Terminal Commands</summary>

## Terminal Commands

Dirb is used to discover hidden directories and pages on a target website. Pass the target URL; any output lines starting with `+` indicate discovered pages.

```bash
dirb http://fakebank.thm
```

Example idea of what you are looking for: dirb reports existing paths such as `http://fakebank.thm/images` and `http://fakebank.thm/bank-transfer`. Use the hidden `/bank-transfer` path in the browser to continue the attack.

  <summary>Defensive Security Intro</summary>

## Introduction

Defensive security is about defending and securing devices and systems by detecting and investigating attacks, then responding before damage occurs. Unlike offensive security, you do not attack systems—you monitor and protect them. In this TryHackMe room, you help apprentice SOC analyst Joe use a monitoring dashboard to spot suspicious traffic, identify the attack, and contain it against FakeBank.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **Think like a Defender**
  - Defensive security is the process of defending and securing devices and systems
  - Focus areas: detecting attacks, investigating them, and responding before damage occurs
  - Contrast with offensive security: defenders monitor and protect; they do not attack systems
- [x] **Detect Suspicious Activity**
  - Joe is an apprentice SOC analyst on his first solo shift
  - Real SOC analysts use monitoring dashboards to separate normal activity from suspicious behaviour
  - Lab steps:
    - Open the monitoring dashboard
    - Review recent alerts
    - Identify the suspicious source IP
  - Monitoring tools show what activity is taking place on computing devices so defenders can confirm legitimacy and investigate the rest
  - Suspicious source IP generating the traffic: **32.122.195.63**
- [x] **Identify the Attack**
  - Knowing something is wrong is only half the battle—you must determine what the attacker is trying to do
  - Lab steps:
    - Investigate the attack that has occurred
    - View the "URL Discovery Attempts" list
    - Look at the latest "URL Discovery Attempts" entry
  - The dashboard history shows the attacker rapidly trying many attempts to access hidden pages
  - Once you know the attacker's goal, you can stop them and fix the weakness that allowed the attack
  - Latest URL the attacker tried to find: **https://fakebank.com/admin**
- [x] **Stop the Attack (containment)**
  - Immediate priority in defensive security is **containment**—stopping the attack while it is happening to protect the organisation
  - Joe has already completed some security updates; you complete the last action
  - Lab steps:
    - Review the security actions (two already done for you)
    - Block the attacker's IP **32.122.195.63** via "Add Firewall Rule"
    - Select **BLOCK** from the dropdown and press **Apply**
  - Measures this monitoring tool supports:
    - **Blocking the IP address** — prevents the attacker's device from accessing systems entirely (good immediate step)
    - **Applying rate limiting** — limits connections in a given time for everyone; useful when the attacker rapidly hits many pages
    - **Updating security rules** — tightens access controls to sensitive pages the attacker slipped through
  - Success flag: **THM{FAKEBANK-SECURED}**

## 2-Computer Fundamentals

<details>
  <summary>Inside a Computer System</summary>

## Introduction

Before securing systems, you need to understand what you are securing. This TryHackMe room is the first in the Computer Fundamentals module and uses a castle analogy: you cannot defend a castle you have never seen. You learn the building blocks of a computer, how they connect, and what happens from power-on to a running operating system—kept at a fundamentals level without deep jargon.

**Learning objectives:** recognize and understand the functions of various computing components.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **Why fundamentals matter**
  - Defending without understanding components is like defending an unseen castle
  - You need the layout (where things live), who enters and how, and who can move or change “treasure”
  - After this room you should have a general idea of how components interact to serve users
- [x] **Shared building blocks**
  - Nearly every computer system includes the same core parts, each with its own job
  - The room maps PC components to a human-body analogy (skeleton/nerves, brain, short-term memory, etc.)
  - Interactive static site: identify components to earn the flag `THM{4llpccomp0n3nts1d3nt1f13d}`
- [x] **Motherboard**
  - Like the skeleton and nervous system: holds components and connects them
  - Typical desktop board: CPU socket, RAM slots, expansion slots, ports
  - Every other component plugs into or connects through the motherboard
- [x] **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**
  - Comparable to part of the brain: continuously executes instructions
  - Modern CPUs have multiple cores that handle instructions in parallel
  - Connects via the CPU socket on the motherboard
- [x] **RAM (Random Access Memory)**
  - Like short-term / working memory: holds data the CPU needs quickly
  - **Volatile** — contents are lost when power is lost
  - Modern modules use technologies such as DDR5 or DDR6 for speed
- [x] **Storage (SSD / HDD)**
  - Like long-term memory: data saved permanently (until deleted or overwritten)
  - **HDD** — older tech with moving parts; large capacity at lower cost, slower
  - **SSD** — no moving parts; memory chips; much faster
  - Connects via SATA cables or PCI Express slots
- [x] **Network Adapter**
  - Like vocal cords for communication with other systems
  - Wired and wireless variants; often embedded on the motherboard or added as expansion cards
  - Typically connects via PCI Express
- [x] **Power Supply (PSU)**
  - Like the heart pumping blood: supplies energy to all components
  - Must provide enough wattage; undersized PSU can cause failure
  - Takes outlet power and distributes it via connectors (main motherboard connector, Molex, etc.)
- [x] **Graphics Card**
  - Like the visual cortex: turns OS/program data into images for a monitor
  - Connects to PCI Express slots on the motherboard
- [x] **Input / Output**
  - Input: keyboard, microphone, mouse, scanner
  - Output: monitor, printer, speakers
  - Common connectors: USB, HDMI, DisplayPort
- [x] **Boot sequence (press Start / power button)**
  - Analogy: waking up and checking that everything works before starting the day
  - **Step 1 — Press the power button:** signal to the PSU to allow power to flow
  - **Step 2 — Firmware starts:** UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) manages startup; BIOS does a similar job but has largely been replaced by UEFI
  - **Step 3 — Power-On Self Test (POST):** checks that required components are present, configured, and working
  - **Step 4 — Select boot device:** UEFI uses an ordered priority list of devices to find the OS boot routine
  - **Step 5 — Initiate bootloader:** bootloader loads the OS from the boot device into RAM; UEFI then hands control of components to the OS
  - Boot-exercise flag: `THM{pc5ucce55fully5t4rt3d}`
- [x] **Why this matters for cyber security**
  - Later topics often require recalling what each component does and how they interact
  - The boot process is especially important because it can be targeted by attackers
  - Next room (coming soon): Computer Types — how component combinations create different system types

## Summary

Inside a Computer System covers the core PC building blocks—motherboard, CPU, RAM, storage (HDD/SSD), network adapter, PSU, graphics card, and I/O—using a human-body analogy, then walks through the five-step boot path from power button to UEFI/POST, boot-device selection, bootloader, and OS in RAM. Interactive static sites reinforce component ID and boot order; flags `THM{4llpccomp0n3nts1d3nt1f13d}` and `THM{pc5ucce55fully5t4rt3d}` mark completion. These fundamentals matter later because component roles and the boot process underpin many security topics.

  <summary>Computer Types</summary>

## Introduction

Sophia was connecting a new device to her home WiFi when she noticed “NexusCool Fridge X17”—her neighbor’s smart refrigerator. The moment underscored a core idea of this TryHackMe room: computers are no longer only laptops and phones; they also hide in everyday objects (appliances, doorbells, and more). Through Sophia’s summer internship story at Nova Labs, the room teaches you to identify and distinguish computers you use directly (laptops, smartphones) and indirectly (servers, IoT devices, embedded systems), and why each type fits its purpose.

**Learning objectives:** identify and distinguish types of computers used directly and indirectly, and understand what makes each suited to its purpose.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **Sophia’s insight — computers everywhere**
  - Smart devices (e.g. a network-connected fridge) show that “computer” is broader than screens and keyboards
  - Many systems are used indirectly—you never sit in front of them, but they still process data and act in the world
- [x] **Month 1 — computers you sit in front of (and ones you don’t)**
  - Not all computers are meant to move
  - Not all computers are meant for people to sit in front of
  - Four similar-looking types serve different purposes: laptop, desktop, workstation, server
- [x] **Laptop**
  - Screen and keyboard: yes
  - Main purpose: portable everyday computing (email, documents, general work)
  - Trade-off: small, battery-powered form factor makes sustained cooling hard; long heavy tasks can slow the machine
- [x] **Desktop**
  - Screen and keyboard: yes
  - Main purpose: sustained performance at a fixed location
  - Wall power and better cooling support longer, steadier workloads than a typical laptop
  - Designed for consistency rather than mobility
- [x] **Workstation**
  - Screen and keyboard: yes
  - Main purpose: precision and reliability for professional tasks (simulations, 3D models)
  - Looks like a desktop but uses specialized components to reduce errors during long or complex computations
- [x] **Server**
  - Screen and keyboard: usually no dedicated ones
  - Main purpose: providing services to many users over a network
  - Runs continuously, answering many requests at once; users often never touch the hardware directly
- [x] **Month 2 — computers hiding in everyday objects**
  - The most powerful computer many people own fits in a pocket
  - Millions more hide in doors, lamps, coffee machines, and similar devices
- [x] **Smartphone**
  - Pocket-sized computer optimized for battery life and connectivity
  - Examples: iPhone, Android phone
  - Currently the most popular pocket-sized computer
- [x] **Tablet**
  - Touch-first computer with a larger screen
  - Examples: iPad, drawing tablet
- [x] **IoT device**
  - Network-connected device with a single purpose
  - Examples: thermostat, smart doorbell, fitness tracker
  - Reports data or receives commands over a network
- [x] **Embedded computer**
  - Computer built into another device
  - Examples: coffee maker controller, automatic door sensor, lamp dimmer chip
  - May not connect to a network; often runs silently for years inside the host machine
- [x] **IoT vs Embedded**
  - Both can be small and single-purpose
  - Key difference is **connectivity**: IoT devices join a network; embedded computers may not connect to anything
  - Example: automatic doors use an embedded computer to detect movement and open—invisible, reliable, everywhere
- [x] **Why computers come in different flavors**
  - There is no single “best” computer that does everything well
  - Every design is a **trade-off**
  - Mobility costs power: smaller portable systems sacrifice sustained performance
  - Reliability costs money: servers and critical systems add redundancy (extra power supplies, disks)
  - Purpose shapes interaction: you touch a phone; you ask a server for information; an IoT device works quietly without demanding attention
  - Right tool for the job—not one machine for all jobs
- [x] **Interactive challenge**
  - Complete the static site (View Site) on computer types
  - Flag: `THM{8_computer_types}`

<details>
  <summary>Lab</summary>

## Summary

Through Sophia’s Nova Labs internship, this room maps eight computer types—laptop, desktop, workstation, server, smartphone, tablet, IoT device, and embedded computer—and shows why purpose and trade-offs (mobility vs power, reliability vs cost, connectivity vs isolation) drive design. Interactive static-site completion yields `THM{8_computer_types}`. The takeaway: there is no best computer, only the right tool for the job—and many of the most important systems are the ones you never see.

<details>
  <summary>Client-Server Basics</summary>

## Introduction

Early computers mostly worked alone—local files, local programs, no communication with other machines. Organizations then interconnected systems for information exchange and resource sharing (precursors of the internet such as ARPANET, CYCLADES, NPL, and NSFNET). Interconnected systems specialized into roles that offer and consume services. This TryHackMe room explains how that works through the **client-server model**, using a pizza-takeaway analogy and a practical HTTP GET lab.

**Learning objectives (surface level):** client-server model, DNS, client, server, port, protocol, and network.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **From standalone machines to networks**
  - Early computers stored their own files and ran their own programs without talking to others
  - Interconnecting systems enabled exchange and sharing regardless of distance
  - Historical networks paved the way for the modern internet: ARPANET, CYCLADES, NPL, NSFNET
  - Systems began specializing—like people offering specific skills as services
- [x] **Pizza analogy — service, client, and server**
  - Alice and Bob order from Luigi’s Pizza: Alice chooses the order; Bob delivers the request and brings the response home
  - **Client** initiates the request (e.g. browser requesting a webpage)
  - **Server** provides the service / serves the resource
  - The client is always the one who initiates the request
- [x] **Request and response**
  - A correctly formed request for an available resource yields a successful response
  - Bad formatting or unavailable resources yield an error response (e.g. no pepperoni, or order not understood)
  - In computing: browser (client) requests a webpage; server sends the page (or an error) back
- [x] **Protocol**
  - A protocol defines how a client communicates with a server
  - Includes: commands both sides understand (e.g. GET), request structure, syntax/language, expected responses, and responses to faulty requests
  - Bob in the analogy is like the protocol that carries a shared language and order format between Alice and Luigi’s
- [x] **Port**
  - A **port** identifies a specific service running on a system
  - Clients must connect using the correct port for that service
  - Analogy: takeaway customers use a specific door; multiple services (takeaway, dine-in, delivery) use different doors
  - One server can run multiple services at once, each on a different port
- [x] **DNS (Domain Name Service)**
  - Names alone are not enough to reach a destination (like knowing “Luigi’s Pizza” without coordinates)
  - DNS resolves a name (e.g. a website) to a server location
  - That location is an **Internet Protocol (IP) address**—the “home address” for computer systems
- [x] **HTTP(S) — web communication in practice**
  - **HTTP(S)** is a **stateless** client-server protocol for the World Wide Web
  - Each request is processed independently; the protocol itself does not remember previous requests
  - Applications add state with session identifiers (cookies/tokens) so you stay logged in across requests
  - Without sessions, you would authenticate on every request
- [x] **HTTP methods (commands)**
  - RFCs define 9 core HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, CONNECT, TRACE
  - Room focus: **GET** — retrieve a resource from a web server (e.g. `GET https://tryhackme.com/index.php`)
  - Browsers construct GET messages behind the scenes when you type a URL
  - Server responds with a **status code** and the requested information
- [x] **Lab: inspect a GET request (DevTools Network)**
  - Start the lab machine; open Firefox; visit `http://httpdemo.local:8080`
  - Open Developer Tools (F12 or Inspect) → **Network** tab → reload the page
  - Click the first GET entry to inspect fields:
    - **Scheme** — HTTP or HTTPS
    - **Host** — name of the host you request from
    - **Filename** — file requested; `"/"` maps to `index.html`
    - **Address** — IP of the host (lab example: `127.0.0.1` when hosted locally)
    - **Status** — success indicator (example: **200 OK**)
  - Response has two parts: **header** (metadata) and **body** (requested content, e.g. HTML of the index page)
- [x] **Room Q&A answers**
  - Identify a specific service on a server → **Port**
  - Address of a server → **Internet Protocol address**
  - Host in `https://www.iamlearning.thm/contact` → **www.iamlearning.thm**
  - Scheme in that URL → **https**
- [x] **What comes next**
  - Next room covers the basics of **virtualization**—the infrastructure that supports internet services

- [ ] In the right-hand panel, note:
  - [ ] **Scheme** — HTTP or HTTPS
  - [ ] **Host** — name of the host you requested
  - [ ] **Filename** — file requested; `"/"` maps to `index.html`
  - [ ] **Address** — IP of the host (lab example: `127.0.0.1` when hosted locally)
  - [ ] **Status** — success indicator (example: **200 OK**)

### **Task 5: Read the response body**

- [ ] With the same GET selected, open the **Response** tab.
- [ ] Confirm the body is the **HTML** of the index page.
- [ ] Remember: the response has a **header** (metadata) and a **body** (content).

  <summary>Questions and Answers</summary>

## Questions and Answers

### Question 1: What problem did early interconnected networks aim to solve?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Information exchange and resource sharing regardless of distance
- [x] Precursors of the internet include ARPANET, CYCLADES, NPL, and NSFNET

</details>

### Question 2: In the client-server model, who initiates communication?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] The **client** always initiates the request
- [x] The **server** replies by providing the service or resource

</details>

### Question 3: In the pizza analogy, what do Alice, Bob, and Luigi’s represent?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] **Alice / browser** — client that wants a service (webpage / pizza order)
- [x] **Bob / protocol** — carries the request and response in a shared language and format
- [x] **Luigi’s / server** — system that serves the resource

</details>

### Question 4: What happens if a request is malformed or the resource is unavailable?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] You get an error response
- [x] Example: no pepperoni available, or the server does not understand the order

</details>

### Question 5: What does a protocol define?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Commands the client and server understand (e.g. GET)
- [x] How a request is structured
- [x] What syntax/language is used
- [x] What response to give for successful and faulty requests

</details>

### Question 6: What do we use to identify a specific service on a server?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] **Port**

</details>

### Question 7: Can one server run multiple services, and how are they distinguished?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Yes — one server can run multiple services at the same time
- [x] Each service listens on a different port (like different doors for takeaway, dine-in, delivery)

</details>

### Question 8: What does DNS stand for, and what does it do?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] **Domain Name Service**
- [x] Resolves a name (e.g. a website) to a server location
- [x] That location is an **Internet Protocol (IP) address**

</details>

### Question 9: What do we call the address of a server?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] **Internet Protocol address** (IP address)

</details>

### Question 10: What does it mean that HTTP(S) is stateless?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Each request is processed independently
- [x] The protocol itself does not retain information about previous requests
- [x] Apps add state with session IDs (cookies/tokens) so login can persist across requests

</details>

### Question 11: Name the nine core HTTP methods listed in the room.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] GET
- [x] POST
- [x] PUT
- [x] DELETE
- [x] PATCH
- [x] HEAD
- [x] OPTIONS
- [x] CONNECT
- [x] TRACE

</details>

### Question 12: What is the GET method used for?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Retrieve a resource from a web server
- [x] Example: `GET https://tryhackme.com/index.php` retrieves the homepage
- [x] The browser builds the request when you navigate to a URL

</details>

### Question 13: In DevTools, what do Scheme, Host, Filename, Address, and Status tell you?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] **Scheme** — HTTP or HTTPS
- [x] **Host** — name of the host requested
- [x] **Filename** — file requested; `"/"` means `index.html`
- [x] **Address** — IP where the site is hosted (lab example: `127.0.0.1`)
- [x] **Status** — whether the request succeeded (e.g. **200 OK**)

</details>

### Question 14: What are the two parts of an HTTP response?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] **Response header** — metadata about the response
- [x] **Response body** — the requested content (e.g. HTML)

</details>

### Question 15: What would be the host in `https://www.iamlearning.thm/contact`?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] `www.iamlearning.thm`

</details>

### Question 16: What would be the scheme in `https://www.iamlearning.thm/contact`?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] `https`

</details>

### Question 17: How do you open the Network inspector in the Firefox lab?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Press **F12** or right-click → **Inspect**
- [x] Open the **Network** tab, reload the page, then click the first GET entry

</details>

### Question 18: What topic does the room say comes next after client-server basics?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- [x] Basics of **virtualization** — infrastructure that supports internet services

</details>

</details>

## Summary

Client-Server Basics explains how networked machines offer and consume services: the client initiates requests, the server responds, protocols define the shared rules, ports identify services, and DNS maps names to IP addresses. A pizza analogy makes the model concrete; an HTTP GET lab in Firefox DevTools shows scheme, host, path, IP, status codes, and response headers/bodies. Room answers include Port, Internet Protocol address, host `www.iamlearning.thm`, and scheme `https`. Next up: virtualization.
