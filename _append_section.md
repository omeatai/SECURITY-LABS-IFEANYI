  <summary>Inside a Computer System</summary>

## Introduction

Sophia was connecting a new device to her home WiFi when she noticed “NexusCool Fridge X17”—her neighbor’s smart refrigerator. The moment underscored a core idea of this TryHackMe room: computers are no longer only laptops and phones; they also hide in everyday objects (appliances, doorbells, and more). Through Sophia’s summer internship story at Nova Labs, the room teaches you to identify and distinguish computers you use directly (laptops, smartphones) and indirectly (servers, IoT devices, embedded systems), and why each type fits its purpose.

**Learning objectives:** identify and distinguish types of computers used directly and indirectly, and understand what makes each suited to its purpose.

## Detailed Explanation

- [x] **Sophia’s insight — computers everywhere**
  - Smart devices (e.g. a network-connected fridge) show that “computer” is broader than screens and keyboards
  - Many systems are used indirectly—you never sit in front of them, but they still process data and act in the world
- [x] **Month 1 — computers you sit in front of (and ones you don’t)**
  - Not all computers are meant to move
  - Not all computers are meant for people to sit in front of
  - Four similar-looking types serve different purposes: laptop, desktop, workstation, server
- [x] **Laptop**
  - Screen and keyboard: yes
  - Main purpose: portable everyday computing (email, documents, general work)
  - Trade-off: small, battery-powered form factor makes sustained cooling hard; long heavy tasks can slow the machine
- [x] **Desktop**
  - Screen and keyboard: yes
  - Main purpose: sustained performance at a fixed location
  - Wall power and better cooling support longer, steadier workloads than a typical laptop
  - Designed for consistency rather than mobility
- [x] **Workstation**
  - Screen and keyboard: yes
  - Main purpose: precision and reliability for professional tasks (simulations, 3D models)
  - Looks like a desktop but uses specialized components to reduce errors during long or complex computations
- [x] **Server**
  - Screen and keyboard: usually no dedicated ones
  - Main purpose: providing services to many users over a network
  - Runs continuously, answering many requests at once; users often never touch the hardware directly
- [x] **Month 2 — computers hiding in everyday objects**
  - The most powerful computer many people own fits in a pocket
  - Millions more hide in doors, lamps, coffee machines, and similar devices
- [x] **Smartphone**
  - Pocket-sized computer optimized for battery life and connectivity
  - Examples: iPhone, Android phone
  - Currently the most popular pocket-sized computer
- [x] **Tablet**
  - Touch-first computer with a larger screen
  - Examples: iPad, drawing tablet
- [x] **IoT device**
  - Network-connected device with a single purpose
  - Examples: thermostat, smart doorbell, fitness tracker
  - Reports data or receives commands over a network
- [x] **Embedded computer**
  - Computer built into another device
  - Examples: coffee maker controller, automatic door sensor, lamp dimmer chip
  - May not connect to a network; often runs silently for years inside the host machine
- [x] **IoT vs Embedded**
  - Both can be small and single-purpose
  - Key difference is **connectivity**: IoT devices join a network; embedded computers may not connect to anything
  - Example: automatic doors use an embedded computer to detect movement and open—invisible, reliable, everywhere
- [x] **Why computers come in different flavors**
  - There is no single “best” computer that does everything well
  - Every design is a **trade-off**
  - Mobility costs power: smaller portable systems sacrifice sustained performance
  - Reliability costs money: servers and critical systems add redundancy (extra power supplies, disks)
  - Purpose shapes interaction: you touch a phone; you ask a server for information; an IoT device works quietly without demanding attention
  - Right tool for the job—not one machine for all jobs
- [x] **Interactive challenge**

Interactive static-site completion yields `THM{8_computer_types}`. The takeaway: there is no best computer, only the right tool for the job—and many of the most important systems are the ones you never see.
