  ##### 1. What is Gobuster?
  - [ ] [Gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) is a tool used to brute-force: 
      - [ ] URIs (directories and files) in web sites.
      - [ ] DNS subdomains (with wildcard support).
      - [ ] Open Amazon S3 buckets
      - [ ] Open Google Cloud buckets
      - [ ] TFTP servers
  - [ ] Gobuster will take a list of potential page or directory names and try accessing a website with each of them; if the page exists, it tells you.

  
  ##### 2. Using Gobuster To Find Hidden Website Pages
  - [ ] Type the following command into the terminal to find potentially hidden pages on website
  ```
  gobuster -u http://fakebank.thm -w wordlist.txt dir
  ```
  - [ ] -u is used to state the website we're scanning
  - [ ] -w takes a list of words to iterate through to find hidden pages.
